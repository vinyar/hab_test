# The default implementation is that the software specified in $pkg_source is
# downloaded, checksum-verified, and placed in $HAB_CACHE_SRC_PATH/$pkgfilename,
# which resolves to a path like /hab/cache/src/filename.tar.gz. You should
# override this behavior if you need to change how your binary source is
# downloaded, if you are not downloading any source code at all, or if your are
# cloning from git. If you do clone a repo from git, you must override
# do_verify() to return 0.

# The default implementation tries to verify the checksum specified in the plan
# against the computed checksum after downloading the source tarball to disk.
# If the specified checksum doesn't match the computed checksum, then an error
# and a message specifying the mismatch will be printed to stderr. You should
# not need to override this behavior unless your package does not download
# any files.

# if you have additional configuration changes to make or other software to

# this location because of do_build() using the --prefix option when calling the

# specific directories in your package, or installing pre-built binaries into

# binaries stripped at all.
